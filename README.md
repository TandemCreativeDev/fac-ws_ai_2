## Agentic Workflows & Humanâ€“AI Pair Programming in Real Development

### Overview

In this workshop, you'll work in human-AI pairs to build a Kanban board application using Claude Code as your AI partner. The focus is on practicing effective AI-assisted development, improving prompt hygiene, and fostering human oversight while collaborating with AI.

### What to Expect

You will:

* Collaborate with both human teammates and AI partners.
* Develop a Kanban board application as a team.
* Practice prompt refinement and iterative AI guidance.

The task details are available in [TASK.md](TASK.md).

### Getting Started

Make sure your development environment is set up as outlined in the pre-work materials. Use Claude Code to assist with planning, coding, testing, and documentation.
