# Functional Specification for Kanban Board Application

## Overview
A simple Kanban board application with three columns ("To Do", "Doing", and "Done") that allows users to create, move, and delete tasks using a clean and minimal UI.

## Core Features

### 1. Board UI

- Clean, minimal UI styled with Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

### 2. Task Management

- **Move tasks**:
  - Button or dropdown interface to move tasks between columns
  - No drag-and-drop functionality

- **Delete tasks**:
  - Button to remove a task from the board entirely

### 3. Data Storage
- Use a local JSON database for data persistence
- Potential to migrate to SQLite in future iterations

2. User can add a new task via a form, which appears in the "To Do" column
3. User can move tasks between columns using buttons or dropdown selectors
4. User can delete tasks as needed
5. All changes persist between sessions via the JSON database
