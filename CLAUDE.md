## Review Process Guidelines

ALWAYS follow these steps when reviewing code:

1. **Check CLAUDE.md standards first**:

   ```bash
   [lint command]
   ```

2. **Run all checks**:

   ```bash
   [check command]
   ```

3. **Review outputs and iterate until all issues are resolved**

4. **Assess compliance**:
   For each standard, explicitly state ✅ or ❌ and explain why:

   - Code style and formatting
   - Naming conventions
   - Architecture patterns (refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md`)
   - Error handling
   - Test coverage
   - Documentation

5. **Self-review checklist**:
   - [ ] Code follows defined patterns
   - [ ] No debug/commented code
   - [ ] Error handling implemented
   - [ ] Tests written and passing
   - [ ] Documentation updated
